## gitignore

This repo provides a collection of `.gitignore` templates for various programming languages, frameworks, and tools. The `.gitignore` file is a configuration file that tells Git which files and directories to ignore when tracking changes in a project.

The repository includes a comprehensive set of `.gitignore` templates that can be used in different projects. These templates are organized by programming language or framework and include common files and directories that should be ignored in those projects.

Using a `.gitignore` file is essential in maintaining a clean and organized repository. By ignoring unnecessary files, developers can keep their repositories small, avoid accidentally committing sensitive information, and prevent merge conflicts caused by different file versions.
